<p>A wise man once said, "People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do." His name was Isaac Asimov.</p>

<p>He knew <i>something</i> about an <b>awful lot of things</b>, which is why he was a wise man.</p>

<p>However, there were also some things that he knew nothing about. Or so I've been told.</p>
