<h1>Issac Asimov: A Wise Guy (or a wiseguy?)</h1>

<p>A wise man once said, "People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do." His name was Isaac Asimov.</p>

<p>Asimov knew <i>something</i> about an <b>awful lot of things</b>, which is why he was <u>a wise man</u>.</p>

<p>However, there were also some things that Asimov knew nothing about. But he would not admit this to others.</p>
