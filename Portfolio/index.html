      <h1>Looking for me?</h1>
      <p>I'm Doug Hoepker, an editor and project manager with more than 16 years experience who has worked in print (newspaper & books), online, and academic publishing. Iâ€™m also currently cutting my teeth in <a href="https://betamore.com/academy/front-end-web-development/">front-end web development</a>. This website was hand-coded and built by me.</p>
      <p>I live in Baltimore City with my wife, our black cat, and more than 4,000 records. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the city of Baltimore and advocating on its behalf, DJ-ing in bars and for a popular podcast, watching the O's, and consuming as many flavors of ice cream as possible.</p>
